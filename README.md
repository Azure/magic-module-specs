## Overview

This repository is where we put all magic-module specifications for Azure resources. [Magic-module](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules) is an open source utility developed by Google to autogenerate support code in a variety of open source DevOps tools.

For Azure resources, we chose to generate [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) code by magic-module. So we extended magic-module to support both Azure resources and GCP resources side-by-side. Please make sure you are using the Azure-extended magic-module instead of the original one when generating code from the specifications in this repository.

The repository contains specifications for Azure resources supported in open source DevOps tools. Each resource specifications should be put in an isolated folder under the `specs` folder of root (i.e. `<resource folder i>`). For example, [`/batchaccount`](https://github.com/Azure/magic-module-specs/tree/master/specs/batchaccount) folder contains all specifications related to [Azure batch account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/batchmanagement/batchaccount).

Specifications of a resource consist of the following items:

* An `api.yaml` defining Azure SDK structure as well as the standard user interface of the DevOps tools
* An `ansible.yaml` defining Ansible specific override to the `api.yaml`
* A `terraform.yaml` defining Terraform specific overrides to the `api.yaml`
* Zero or more `.erb` files defining special code to be embedded in the generated code
* Zero or more `.yaml` files under `examples` folder defining examples and test cases

For a detailed description of the items mentioned above, please refer to [RESOURCE_SPEC](RESOURCE_SPEC.md).

This repository also includes all generated code in `generated`. The folder strcture within these generated folders exactly matches the [ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) and [terraform provider for Azure](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-azurerm) respectively.

Please refer to the [Workflow](#workflow) section about how to make contributions to DevOps tools using the generated code.
